For zres that have been ifconfig'd up, ifAdminStatus and ifOperStatus in the IF-MIB (RFC 2863) can be combined to determine link state. The oids are:
ifAdminStatus  1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.7
ifOperStatus    1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.8

You can determine when the last change occurred by looking at:
ifLastChange   1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.9

Here are the relevant sections from RFC 2863. (Note that these values are also available for zhps, eths, etc.)

ifAdminStatus OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX  INTEGER {
                up(1),       -- ready to pass packets
                down(2),
                testing(3)   -- in some test mode
            }
    MAX-ACCESS  read-write
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
            "The desired state of the interface.  The testing(3) state
            indicates that no operational packets can be passed.  When a
            managed system initializes, all interfaces start with
            ifAdminStatus in the down(2) state.  As a result of either
            explicit management action or per configuration information
            retained by the managed system, ifAdminStatus is then
            changed to either the up(1) or testing(3) states (or remains
            in the down(2) state)."

ifOperStatus OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX  INTEGER {
                up(1),        -- ready to pass packets
                down(2),
                testing(3),   -- in some test mode
                unknown(4),   -- status can not be determined
                              -- for some reason.
                dormant(5),
                notPresent(6),    -- some component is missing
                lowerLayerDown(7) -- down due to state of
                                  -- lower-layer interface(s)
            }
    MAX-ACCESS  read-only
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
            "The current operational state of the interface.  The
            testing(3) state indicates that no operational packets can
            be passed.  If ifAdminStatus is down(2) then ifOperStatus
            should be down(2).  If ifAdminStatus is changed to up(1)
            then ifOperStatus should change to up(1) if the interface is
            ready to transmit and receive network traffic; it should
            change to dormant(5) if the interface is waiting for
            external actions (such as a serial line waiting for an
            incoming connection); it should remain in the down(2) state
            if and only if there is a fault that prevents it from going
            to the up(1) state; it should remain in the notPresent(6)
            state if the interface has missing (typically, hardware)
            components."

    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
            "The value of sysUpTime at the time the interface entered
            its current operational state.  If the current state was
            entered prior to the last re-initialization of the local
            network management subsystem, then this object contains a
            zero value."
