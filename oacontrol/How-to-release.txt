# How to Release OAControl
#############################

development takes place primarily in the developers src trees under oacontrol/src/<name>. 
When ready developers move their code into oacontrol/src/trunk
When it builds and tests ok, tag the oacontrol/src/trunk

"Build" the tagged trunk, now in oacontrol/src/tags
using make
Building an initial release  means producing the portlet eggs, and a tarball of graphics and scripts. 
There are individual targets for the two eggs as well.
Look in the release directory for build products.
