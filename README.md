# z_oacontrol
A project based in Zenoss to automate ATCA telephony network and compute equipment.
The company, Znyx Networks, made the equipment and I made this front end for it. The project was never finished, due to lack of interest from customers, who used SNMP tools mostly. Reviving the project would require a refactoring of Javascript, but the use of SVGs for animation still makes sense. The SVG would need a new library, as time has passed by the old one.

There is an interesting SVG file that used AJAX ( too early for React or Angular) to get real time connection to the many LEDs on the equipment face.

The equipment was a six slot chassis with two switches, fully HA.
